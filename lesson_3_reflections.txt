When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you're working on multiple computers or with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Sometimes changes to the repository origin might overwrite your code (?) or someone else might be making changes that you don't want in your version...eventually it would all have to merge together, though, right?
